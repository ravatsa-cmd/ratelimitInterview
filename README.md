Below are the improvements i can think of
1) Build a Redis cache. This will help in transaction management in a distributed environment.
2) Build a load balancer based on nginx.
3) Code and implementation is not complete but tried to deliver the concept. With more time and people I believe we can make it production grade.
4) Loggers to be pushed to kafka/messaging queue for monitoring/observability.
5) Tried to build a modular code. Idea is that if implementation is modular expansion and maintainance is easier
6) Rate limiter can be a platform offering, that way we can throttle messages.
7) We can have inbuilt intelligence module or if an intelligence module is built as an offering we can connect this module to that via api's;
